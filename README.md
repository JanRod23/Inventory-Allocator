- Some of the functions used to test everything were placed towards the bottom of the javascript file. There are 2 buttons which were commented out on the HTML
  file, they were used for unit testing. The data comes from a test array, which was constantly changed and had a lot of faulty input and edge cases to assure
  the results are accurate. Feel free to edit those inputs if you want to test anything.
